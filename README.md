# Box-Office-Revenue-Prediction-Project
This project used data scraped from the TMDB website to predict if a movie would be a big box office.  
  
We classified all the movies into three classes:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Lucrative movies;   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Break-even movies;   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Money-losing movies.  
  
Details description of this project are in file "Final Report.pdf".
